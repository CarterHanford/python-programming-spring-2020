    "This is the Jupyter Notebook for Project 1 in GIS-5090; Intro to Python Programming for GIS and Remote Sensing. Project 1 spans a number of introductory topics that we have learned in class, such as exploring and describing spatial data, using **cursors** to search for certain attributes, writing for loops and print statements to describe our spatial data, and putting all of these concepts into an organized IDE such as Jupyter. This project has 5 problems, with each problem covering a topic listed above.\n",
