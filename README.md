### Introduction

This is the personal repository for GIS5090 - Intro to Python Programming for GIS and Remote Sensing, taken in spring 2020. This course includes introductory [python](https://www.python.org/) concepts, general workflow tips, and using these concepts and workflows from a GIS perspective. Most of the course revolves around using **`Arcpy`**, a python module created from [Arcpro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home). The `Arcpy` module allows for seamless functionality between ArcPro toolboxes and the python framework, and is fully supported and functional in many python IDE's.

Most of the python code in this repository is accomplished in the [Jupyter IDE](https://jupyter.org/), and all homework, lecture demos, and projects are completed using `Jupyter Notebooks`. Some scripting for creating geoprocessing tools is done in [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). And finally, a few small homework exercises were completed in the Arcpy module within ArcPro, and are saved as .py files.

### Repository Contents

* Each `week` folder includes lecture materials and concepts for the week, along with a simple title for organizational purposes.
* The `project 1` folder includes all the materials for the first python project in the course.
* The `project 2` folder includes the second and final project of the semester, which will eventually have its own github repo.

### About Carter

Carter Hanford graduated in 2018 from `Saint Louis University` (SLU) with a Sociology B.A. from the College of Arts and Sciences and a minor in Mathematics from the department of Mathematics and Statistics. He attended `Jefferson College` prior to his time at SLU, obtaining an associates degree in Mathematics. While an undergrad, Carter was a member of the Saint Louis University NCAA Division 1 baseball team, and during his time on the SLU Baseball team, he was a key contributor on the 2018 Atlantic-10 championship team, starting all 56 games at third base. Him and the team went on to compete on the national level, playing Ole Miss and Missouri State at the University of Mississippi on ESPN in front of 15,000+ fans. 

Carter is now a graduate student working towards a Sociology M.A. and minors in GIS and research methodology from the department of sociology and anthropology. His research interests include: GIS, open-source coding (R, Python), quantitative analysis, and urban sociology. Carter works as a graduate research assistant in the department, conducting research with faculty members and also assisting in their teaching needs. Carter is a member of [Dr. Christopher Prener's](https://chris-prener.github.io/) research team, `PrenerLab`, studying historical redlining practices in the city of St. Louis from a geopgraphic, spatial framework. Carter will graduate in 2021.
